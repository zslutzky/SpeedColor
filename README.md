# SpeedColor
Change the CSS of an HTML element based on a JS cursor speed capturing function. 

See SpeedColor in action: http://jsfiddle.net/zslutzky430/pLd58t2e/1/
Cursometer (mouse movement) code is borrowed. Code from lines 219-254 in JavaScript file are my contribution, in applying the CSS transitions.
